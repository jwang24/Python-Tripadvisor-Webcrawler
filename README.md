# Python-Tripadvisor-Webcrawler
This is my first project with Python. It is a webscraper that traverses through a specified Tripadvisor hotel, extracting reviews and their ratings.
I implemented the os module for directory and file creation/management, urllib and beautifulsoup for webscraping and the threading module for multithreading functionality. 
With the data gathered from the program, one can run their own data analysis. It can, for example, be used in sentiment analysis to determine customer opinions in future reviews.
